Every morning begins the same, and differently.

JW reaches for her Orange Americano — espresso cut with fresh orange, no dairy, no negotiation. Her gut made that decision months ago. For years she started the day with milky coffee and spent the first hour paying for it. The switch was not philosophical. It was practical. Her body said no. She finally listened.

On the other side of the table: milk, poured full and unapologetic into a cup that probably receives more attention than it deserves.

The coffee set came from a porcelain maker still operating out of Hong Kong, discovered during the pandemic. They hand-paint everything — have done for decades. The same workshop produced the wedding china for Prince Charles and Princess Diana, a marriage the whole world inherited opinions about and which famously did not survive its own fairy tale. Objects outlast the stories they were made for. They find new tables, new rituals, new owners who press them into meanings the makers never intended.

This habit of reading too much into objects has honest origins. The TY Chao collection — assembled by grandparents with formidable taste and even more formidable patience — held antique Chinese vases that would command hundreds of millions in today’s money. Growing up in the orbit of such things instils a particular awareness: a vase is never just a vase. It is provenance, judgement, a family’s quiet argument about what endures. Whether one wanted that awareness or not, it arrived with the rest of the inheritance.

And “the rest of the inheritance” is what gets interesting.

Northern Chinese ancestry, most probably, though home is now the south. The evidence is not genealogical but gastric. A deep affinity for wine. A love of stinky cheese — the more pungent the better. Dairy presents no difficulties whatsoever. JW, raised on the coast, craves seafood with the instinct of someone whose forebears pulled dinner from the ocean for centuries. Shellfish here provokes an allergic response that no amount of enthusiasm can override.

This is not preference. It is inheritance at the cellular level.

Lactose tolerance functions as a kind of genetic timestamp. Ancestors who herded cattle on the northern steppes passed down the enzyme — lactase — that breaks down milk sugar well into adulthood. Ancestors who did not herd cattle generally did not. No quantity of willpower or nutritional orthodoxy changes what a gut was built to process. The wellness industry sells milk as universally virtuous or universally suspect depending on the decade. DNA does not care about the decade.

What ought to give pause is how confidently the world prescribes universal answers. Drink milk. Avoid milk. Follow this diet, this philosophy, this strategy for living. Yet the optimal answer is always conditional on variables most people never examine — because the variables are invisible. They are buried in genes, in family, in the particular way centuries of habitation in one geography rather than another shaped the body one presently walks around in.

Two women at the same table, same morning, same light through the same window. Requiring completely different things. The observation extends well beyond breakfast.

A great deal arrives uninvited. Genes, obviously. Allergies and temperaments. But also porcelain, debt, names, reputations, expectations, collections of beautiful things nobody asked for, grudges nobody started, social positions nobody earned. Some of what arrives nourishes. Some quietly poisons. The trouble is that distinguishing between the two takes time — sometimes most of a life.

There is a comparison sometimes drawn between life and walking into a cinema halfway through the film. One spends the duration piecing together the plot, and just as things begin making sense, it is time to leave. One might add that the arrival also involved a bag packed by someone else, half of its contents useful and the other half dead weight, with most of the film spent sorting one from the other.

The instinct is to protest. _Not fair._ And it is not. Fairness is a human craving, not a natural law. Time has never distributed its gifts or its damage evenly and shows no inclination to start.

But JW’s quiet defection from dairy suggests something useful. The gut knows when something is not working — when a habit, a food, a belief, a role costs more than it gives. The question is not whether the signal arrives. It always does. The question is whether it gets heard, or whether the milk keeps getting poured because it always has been.

The great collectors understood this instinctively. The TY Chao collection was not assembled by hoarding. It was assembled by curation — holding what was extraordinary, releasing the rest. That is a skill with applications far beyond porcelain: knowing what to preserve and what to let go.

Most mornings, then, two cups on a table. One with milk, one without. Two bodies running two ancestral programmes, making two different calculations about what sustains them. Neither is wrong. Both are right.

The gut knows best.
