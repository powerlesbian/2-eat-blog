The waiters approached as if bearing relics. The dish was introduced in low, reverent tones: provenance, technique, a meditation on texture. It arrived centred on a vast white plate, a small island of ingredients arranged with geometric restraint. Droplets of sauce were placed in disciplined orbit. It was less a course than a composition.

My partner, JW, watched carefully.

She ate it without comment. I looked up for a verdict. Her expression conveyed the diplomatic neutrality of a minor trade partner declining a major treaty. “Meh,” it said.

  

  

For JW, raised in the back corridors of her grandfather’s Cantonese restaurant, the first question of any dish is not how it looks but how it arrives. Does it steam? Does it announce its birth in fire? In the Cantonese canon, temperature is not an accessory but a moral condition.

The difference between a home kitchen and a restaurant kitchen, she insists, is not taste but heat. Industrial burners roar to life in seconds. Iron woks, heavy and blackened by use, flare into action. Ingredients are flung, seared and served before they have time to wilt into contemplation. The result is wok hei—often translated inadequately as “breath of the wok”—a volatile alchemy of oil, flame and speed. It is quick, hot, faintly dangerous. It is dramatic to watch and impossible to counterfeit on a domestic stove.

The Michelin plate before us, by contrast, was immaculate. It was also still.

Yet I confess to loving it.

As an architect and occasional artist, I am susceptible to composition. Negative space on porcelain feels akin to negative space on a façade. A smear of raspberry coulis can read like an abstract expressionist gesture. A leaf placed at precisely the wrong angle—appearing accidental but almost certainly not—signals restraint, discipline, control. To me, the dining room is a gallery with appetite. One goes not merely to eat but to experience sequencing, colour theory, materiality, even narrative. Wine contributes to the dramaturgy.

JW, however, evaluates a restaurant less as a curator and more as an engineer of thermodynamics.

To her, heat is proof of life. Steam is evidence that flavour compounds are still volatile, rising, urgent. A dish that waits too long to be admired risks cooling into decor. In Cantonese cooking, speed is not sloppiness but precision under pressure. Vegetables retain snap because they have barely met the flame. Aroma blooms because the encounter was violent and brief. The restaurant earns its keep through equipment capable of temperatures no home range can approximate. The spectacle is not plating but combustion.

These are not merely stylistic differences. They reflect two philosophies of what restaurants are for.

One treats the meal as exhibition—carefully arranged, temporally suspended, inviting contemplation before consumption. The other treats it as event—ephemeral, kinetic, optimised for immediacy. The former asks diners to pause; the latter insists they begin at once.

Neither is wrong. Both are theatrical.

Fine dining, for all the critiques already levelled at it, remains a pleasurable art form. A well-composed two-star with a daring wine list can still produce genuine delight. But JW’s quiet “meh” in that three-star dining room was not philistinism. It was a reminder that in some culinary traditions, beauty without heat is incomplete.

Plating may matter. But in certain kitchens, steam matters more.
