My Arabic teacher was fasting during our lesson.

It was early evening — the last stretch before Maghrib, the precise hours when the fast becomes its own kind of weight. A sign at the front of the classroom, next to the whiteboard: *No food or drink.* One of those institutional notices that has always been there, part of the furniture, barely noticed on any other day. That evening it felt different. Almost ironic in its ordinariness — the blunt authority of educational bureaucracy accidentally aligned with one of the oldest spiritual disciplines on earth.

His voice was soft. Gentle in a way that felt deliberate, like he was conserving something. You could tell he was in the final endurance of it — not suffering dramatically, not complaining at all, but present in his body in a way that the well-fed rarely are. And through all of it: smiling. Genuinely smiling.

I had come straight from a week of Chinese New Year celebrations. I come from Chinese culture, and CNY is — like Christmas — a season of deliberate, joyful excess. Banquets, toasts, dishes arriving in waves, the table as an act of abundance and love. My body was still carrying it: the heaviness, the pleasant exhaustion of too much of everything good.

This year, Ramadan and Chinese New Year fell in the same week. Sitting in that classroom after seven days of feasting, watching my teacher hold himself quietly through the last hours of his fast — it was puzzling and, oddly, refreshing. A kind of reset my body had been quietly asking for without knowing how to ask. I suspect that is also something of what the body feels at the beginning of Ramadan: relief, disguised as discipline.

He was choosing to be in that classroom, teaching us the letters of a language he loved, extending his fast into the space of the lesson. Nobody would have said anything if he had taken a sip of water. Nobody would have judged, or even noticed much. But he didn't. That was his.

I found myself newly curious about the architecture of that choice.

## What Ramadan Actually Is

Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar — the month Muslims believe the Quran was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. The fast, called **sawm**, is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. This is not optional observance. It sits alongside prayer, pilgrimage, charity, and profession of faith as a foundational religious obligation.

From **Fajr** (pre-dawn) to **Maghrib** (sunset), observing Muslims abstain from all food, all drink — including water — smoking, and sexual relations. The pre-dawn meal is **Suhoor**, eaten before first light. The breaking of the fast at sunset is **Iftar**, beginning by tradition with dates and water, following the practice of the Prophet.

But the fast is not only physical. Ramadan is explicitly about spiritual discipline — restraint of the ego, increased prayer, Quran recitation, and heightened charity. Anger, gossip, bad behaviour: these are considered to break the *spirit* of the fast even if you haven't touched food. The hunger is the vehicle, not the destination.

## The Same Obligation, a Thousand Tables

What strikes me most about Ramadan, viewed through a food lens, is how a single religious obligation produces such radically different expressions around the world — the same structure, infinitely varied in flavour.

In the **Arab world**, Iftar is a major social event. Long tables, extended family, neighbours. Classic dishes vary by country: harira soup in Morocco, ful medames in Egypt, slow-roasted lamb ouzi in the Gulf. After the meal, Ramadan nights come alive — markets stay open late, people gather in cafés and mosques, the streets hum until well past midnight.

In **Turkey**, a figure called the *davulcu* — a drummer — still walks through some neighbourhoods before dawn, beating a rhythm to wake residents for Suhoor. In cities, Iftar cannons are fired at sunset to signal the moment of breaking fast. These are not ancient relics — they are living traditions, fought for and maintained.

In **Indonesia and Malaysia**, home to the world's largest Muslim populations, the **Bazaar Ramadan** appears every afternoon like clockwork — vast street food markets selling Iftar foods to queues of people. Kolak, a sweet coconut dessert. Ketupat, compressed rice in woven palm leaf. Rendang. The bazaar is its own social institution.

In **South Asia**, Suhoor leans heavy and protein-rich — nihari (a slow-cooked meat stew eaten since the Mughal era), parathas, lentils. Iftar spreads become almost festive in scale: samosas, pakoras, chaat, the bright pink Rooh Afza rose syrup drink that signals the month has arrived.

In **West Africa**, particularly Senegal, the emphasis on communal feeding intensifies. Feeding neighbours, strangers, the poor during Ramadan carries special spiritual merit. The act of feeding becomes explicitly moral.

And in **Western diaspora communities**, Ramadan can be quietly isolating — fasting through a regular workday, no communal infrastructure, colleagues eating lunch around you, no cannon at sunset. Cities like London and New York have begun hosting public Iftar events that bridge Muslim and non-Muslim communities. Food, again, doing the diplomatic work.

## Collective Hunger as Social Technology

Here is the thing I keep returning to: Ramadan is, among other things, an engineered experience of shared deprivation.

Approximately 1.8 billion people fast together during the same lunar month.[^1] Not alone, not privately, but in acknowledged, visible, collective hunger. The person next to you on the bus is hungry. Your teacher is hungry. The shopkeeper is hungry. Hunger, usually a private and often shameful experience, becomes communal and dignified.

Research on shared hardship consistently shows that it accelerates social bonding. A 2014 study in *Psychological Science* found that people who experienced pain together — even minor, induced pain — subsequently behaved more cooperatively and felt greater solidarity than those who did not share the experience.[^2] Ramadan has been engineering this for fourteen centuries.

The Iftar table is where this pays off. There is a reason the tradition begins with dates and water before anything else — the same for everyone, regardless of wealth. Rich and poor, young and old, breaking fast with the same humble food at the same moment. The equalising function of that shared first bite is not incidental. It is theological.

## A Note on Sensitivity

If you are not Muslim and someone around you is fasting: do not pity them. Many Muslims describe Ramadan as their favourite month of the year — a period of unusual clarity, community, and spiritual depth. The hunger is chosen, meaningful, and held with pride.

Do not troubleshoot the rules. They know what they are doing.

When it falls in summer at northern latitudes, fasts can exceed eighteen hours. This is genuinely demanding and taken seriously. When it ends, **Eid al-Fitr** — three days of feasting, gifts, new clothes, family — is the payoff. The arc from fast to feast matters.

## What the Table Reveals

I started thinking about this because my teacher was fasting and still fully present — generous, focused, unhurried. He was not diminished by hunger. He was, if anything, more deliberate.

That is the lesson I keep taking from Ramadan as someone learning to think about food differently: hunger, held with intention and shared with others, is not absence. It is a kind of preparation. The table at the end of the day is not just a meal — it is the point.

Every culture has a version of this: the feast that means more because something came before it. The food that tastes different because it was waited for, earned, shared.

Ramadan just makes it visible.
