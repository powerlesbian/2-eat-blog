There is a kind of hunger that has nothing to do with calories.

I call it stomach memory — the body's archive of every meal that ever made you feel safe. It is the reason a bowl of plain congee can undo you completely, or why the smell of something frying in oil at 7am in a cramped kitchen can collapse the distance between who you are now and who you were at nine years old, eating before school, not yet knowing that food would become one of the most contested territories of your life.

Comfort food is not about the food. It is about the moment of being fed — by a person, a place, a season, a version of yourself that was still hungry enough to be grateful.

## What the Science Actually Says About Cravings

Researchers at the University of Illinois found that comfort foods are strongly tied to social relationships and memories of being cared for, rather than to any inherent property of the food itself. Wansink, Cheney and Chan (2003) showed that the foods people reach for when distressed are almost entirely determined by what they ate in happy social contexts growing up — not nutritional content, not taste profile alone, but emotional association.[^1]

The gut remembers. The enteric nervous system — sometimes called the "second brain" — contains roughly 500 million neurons and communicates bidirectionally with the brain via the vagus nerve. Emeran Mayer's landmark 2011 paper in *Nature Reviews Neuroscience* described this gut-brain axis as a sophisticated two-way signalling system capable of encoding emotional states, stress responses, and yes, memory.[^2] Your gut is not just digesting — it is narrating.

This is not metaphor. It is physiology.

## Eight Years Without Meat, and What I Learned

I became vegetarian at thirteen. By fifteen I was vegan. I stayed that way for eight years, through adolescence, through the particular hunger of being young and broke and principled, through years of reading every study I could find, through arguments at dinner tables, through a body that was sometimes thriving and sometimes quietly running on empty.

I learned many things in those years. I learned to cook from scratch out of necessity. I learned that eating with conviction forces you to pay attention — to ingredients, to sourcing, to the gap between what food labels say and what they mean. I learned that hunger is political: what you can afford to eat, what is available where you live, what your culture considers food at all.

I also learned, slowly and then all at once, to be deeply suspicious of the nutritional consensus.

## The Problem with Nutritional Science

Here is what nobody tells you when you are seventeen and reading breathless articles about the latest dietary breakthrough: much of nutritional science is commissioned.

This is not conspiracy. It is documented fact.

In 2016, Cristin Kearns, Laura Schmidt and Stanton Glantz published a paper in *JAMA Internal Medicine* revealing that the Sugar Research Foundation had, in the 1960s, paid Harvard scientists to produce research downplaying the link between sugar and heart disease — and emphasising dietary fat instead.[^3] Those scientists went on to shape decades of US dietary policy. The low-fat era, with all its consequences, was at least partly the product of purchased conclusions.

Marion Nestle, in *Food Politics* (2002, updated 2013), documented systematically how the food industry funds nutrition research, cultivates relationships with scientists and dietitians, and shapes the guidelines that end up on your cereal box.[^4] Her analysis is not polemical — it is meticulously sourced, and it is damning.

More recently, the PURE study — a large-scale epidemiological investigation published in *The Lancet* in 2017 covering 135,000 people across 18 countries — found that high carbohydrate intake was associated with higher mortality, while fat intake, including saturated fat, was associated with lower risk of stroke.[^5] This directly contradicted decades of official guidance. It did not receive nearly the attention it deserved.

I am not telling you what to eat. I am telling you to notice who is paying for the advice.

## Stomach Memory as Resistance

To eat from memory — to cook the thing that fed you when you had almost nothing, to share food the way it was shared with you — is a quiet act of resistance against the industrial noise of nutritional marketing.

The eight vegan years taught me to question. They also gave me a particular kind of stomach memory: the satisfaction of a meal assembled entirely from things you grew or chose or prepared with your own hands, without apology, without a brand. That memory still lives somewhere behind my ribs.

Empowerment eating is not a diet. It is the practice of knowing why you eat what you eat — not because a study commissioned by a commodity board told you to, but because your body, your history, and your hunger have their own intelligence.

Trust that intelligence. It has been with you longer than the guidelines have.
