#### _On austerity, symbolism and the politics of ghormeh sabzi_

Power often announces itself in banquets. Versailles had its silver platters; Washington has its state dinners; Beijing stages choreography at the Great Hall. Tehran, at least officially, prefers stew.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader from 1989 to 2026, is frequently described in Iranian accounts as favouring simple, traditional fare: **ghormeh sabzi** (a herb stew with kidney beans and lamb), **abgoosht** (a rustic meat-and-chickpea broth, mashed and eaten with flatbread), rice with yogurt, and other home-style _khoresh_ stews. Whether these are truly his “favourites” or merely the cuisine of respectable modesty is almost beside the point. In the Islamic Republic, food is politics by other means.

### Austerity as theatre

Iran’s revolutionary ideology has long prized asceticism. The republic was born in opposition to the perceived decadence of the Shah. Its clerical elite, at least in rhetoric, embody piety, restraint and proximity to the poor. A table laid with ghormeh sabzi — dark, herbaceous, stubbornly domestic — signals continuity with the provinces and distance from cosmopolitan excess.

This is not unique to Iran. Leaders from Mao to Modi have cultivated culinary frugality as a badge of authenticity. But in Iran the symbolism is especially charged. Sanctions, inflation and economic malaise have sharpened public sensitivity to inequality. In such an environment, lobster would be a liability; lentils are safer.

### The national stew

Ghormeh sabzi is an apt emblem. It is ubiquitous yet labour-intensive: parsley, coriander and fenugreek chopped finely; dried limes pricked and simmered; beans softened to a creamy give. It rewards patience over flourish. Abgoosht, too, is communal and unpretentious. The broth is poured off; the solids are mashed with a pestle; bread is torn by hand. One does not Instagram abgoosht. One eats it.

To prefer these dishes — publicly, at least — is to align oneself with a culinary grammar that most Iranians recognise as their own. It is a politics of familiarity.

### What is not on the menu

Equally telling is what is absent from the narrative. There is little talk of French sauces, sushi counters or even the more elaborate courtly Persian dishes that once adorned royal tables. The message is deliberate: the revolution’s guardians do not dine like kings.

Of course, official portrayals of leaders’ habits are curated. States are adept at myth-making; kitchens are no exception. The image of simplicity can coexist with the privileges of office. Yet symbolism matters. In a system that fuses religion and governance, the leader’s supposed palate becomes an extension of doctrine.

### The stew and the state

Food rarely changes policy. It does, however, frame perception. A leader who eats ghormeh sabzi projects rootedness; one who feasts conspicuously risks alienation. In Iran, where legitimacy is constantly negotiated between ideology and material reality, even a bowl of herbs and beans carries weight.

Thus the supreme leader’s table, whether by preference or performance, remains modest. In a region accustomed to spectacle, Iran’s most powerful man is associated not with a banquet hall but with a pot left to simmer.
