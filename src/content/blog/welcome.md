Food is not just fuel. It's memory, culture, medicine, and joy — all on one plate.

I started **Eat for Life** to document the daily, sometimes messy, always interesting practice of eating with intention. Not diet culture. Not restriction. Empowerment.

What does empowerment eating mean to me? It means:

- **Knowing what you're eating and why** — not just calories, but context
- **Listening to your body** over any rulebook
- **Finding pleasure** in the act of feeding yourself well
- **Connecting food to life** — seasons, relationships, energy, mood

This blog is my running log of that exploration. Some posts will be recipes. Some will be rants. Some will be quiet observations about a perfect bowl of something eaten alone on a Tuesday.

Come hungry. Leave nourished.
