	<div class="about-intro">
		<p>
			<strong>Eat for Life</strong> is a food blog about eating with intention — not rules. No calorie counting, no wellness trends, no sponsored spirulina. Just honest writing about what food actually is: memory, culture, medicine, pleasure, and occasionally a disaster in a wok.
		</p>
		<p>
			The blog grows out of a longer obsession with how food, science, history and daily life intersect — an obsession that also lives over at <a href="https://www.drgichao.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drgichao.com</a>, where the same restless curiosity gets applied to everything from gut biology to the economics of the Silk Road.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here, the focus is the table. Pull up a chair.

	<h2>The Team</h2>

	<div class="contributors">

		<div class="contributor">
			<img src="/placeholder-avatar.png" alt="FlyingGG" onerror="this.style.background='#e8e0d5';this.removeAttribute('src')" />
			<h3>FlyingGG</h3>
			<div class="role">Founder & Admin</div>
			<p>
				Pilot-trained, perpetually curious, and deeply suspicious of any food trend that requires a subscription. Writes about the gut-brain axis, comfort food politics, and the kind of Tuesday congee that makes you feel like a person again. Also found at <a href="https://www.drgichao.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drgichao.com</a>.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="contributor">
			<img src="/placeholder-avatar.png" alt="IndianaJen the Foodie" onerror="this.style.background='#e8e0d5';this.removeAttribute('src')" />
			<h3>IndianaJen the Foodie</h3>
			<div class="role">Food Anthropologist & Explorer</div>
			<p>
				IndianaJen has eaten in places you'd need a detailed map and a very good excuse to find. She approaches every meal as a field study and every market as primary research. Somewhere between the street stall and the footnote, she finds the story.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="contributor">
			<img src="/placeholder-avatar.png" alt="Meatlover" onerror="this.style.background='#e8e0d5';this.removeAttribute('src')" />
			<h3>Meatlover</h3>
			<div class="role">Carnivore Correspondent</div>
			<p>
				Has strong opinions about fire, fat, and the correct internal temperature of a ribeye. Believes that most problems can be solved with a longer braise and a better knife. Will not be rushed. Neither will the steak.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="contributor">
			<img src="/placeholder-avatar.png" alt="The Decanted Diva" onerror="this.style.background='#e8e0d5';this.removeAttribute('src')" />
			<h3>The Decanted Diva</h3>
			<div class="role">Wine & Glamour</div>
			<p>
				Former beauty queen. Current wine empress. Once wore a crown; now wears a very good Burgundy. Her palate detects terroir the way others detect drama — effortlessly, and usually correctly. Pairs well with candlelight and strong opinions.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="contributor">
			<img src="/placeholder-avatar.png" alt="The Global Reservation" onerror="this.style.background='#e8e0d5';this.removeAttribute('src')" />
			<h3>The Global Reservation</h3>
			<div class="role">Restaurateur & International Host</div>
			<p>
				Runs restaurants on multiple continents and has forgotten more about hospitality than most people will ever learn. Writes about the business of feeding people at scale — and why the best meal you'll ever have is still the one someone made for you in a kitchen you weren't supposed to be in.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="contributor">
			<img src="/placeholder-avatar.png" alt="Root & Reel" onerror="this.style.background='#e8e0d5';this.removeAttribute('src')" />
			<h3>Root & Reel</h3>
			<div class="role">Farmer · Fisherman · Food Engineer</div>
			<p>
				Grows it, catches it, then reverse-engineers why it tastes the way it does. Equally at home in a field at 5am and a food science lab at midnight. Believes the most important ingredient is the one you understand completely — and that most people don't.
